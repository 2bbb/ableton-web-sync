# ableton-web-sync

Sub-frame synchronization between Ableton Live and websites on remote devices.

This is currently designed for consistent playback without frequent starts/stops or jumps over a WAN. For more frequent jumps while on a shared LAN, check out [node-abletonlink](https://github.com/2bbb/node-abletonlink) and [node-abletonlink-example](https://github.com/2bbb/node-abletonlink-example).
